## 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝚖𝚎 👋

I am a technogeek 🧑‍💻 with over 13 years of experience, along with another 8 years nerding out about cybersecurity and tech in general.
* I like to keep myself busy with designing architectures 🗼 and experimenting with variety of different stacks. 
* I set challenges for ~~no good reason~~ expanding my knowledge and exploring new areas. 
* I enjoy sharing what I've learned while documenting my journey.

## 🔭 𝙼𝚢 𝚙𝚊𝚜𝚝 𝚐𝚒𝚐𝚜:

<!-- * I've developed services to transfer movies 🎬, experimenting with the delivery of vast amounts of data via a P2P network for cinemas in production. I've employed Amazon EC2 instances to convert movies, upload them to S3, and shut down the workers once the process is complete — long before it became mainstream. 🐥
* I implemented a black box test environment to run regression tests for 🏦 banking web services.
* I created an architecture to render NFT images on the e-ink display with Raspberry Pi, Pimoroni Inky pHAT and Python.
* I built an architecture to convert text to Morse code by blinking an LED on Raspberry Pi Zero. Read more [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230205202806/https://fadein.xyz/posts/2021-04-29-morsecipher-architecture/).
